## What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration.

- Jenkins builds and tests our software projects, which continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.

- It also allows us to continuously deliver our software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

- Jenkins offers a straightforward way to set up a continuous integration or continuous delivery environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating other routine development tasks.

- With the help of Jenkins, organizations can speed up the software development process through automation. Jenkins adds development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy static analysis and much more.

- Jenkins achieves CI (Continuous Integration) with the help of plugins. Plugins is used to allow the integration of various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you have to install the plugins for that tool. For example: Maven 2 Project, Git, HTML Publisher, Amazon EC2, etc.

- For example: If any organization is developing a project, then Jenkins will continuously test your project builds and show you the errors in early stages of your development.

- Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

   - Perform a software build using a build system like Gradle or Maven Apache
   - Execute a shell script
   - Archive a build result
   - Running software tests

   ## What are Jenkins Stages

   - In a Jenkins Pipeline, every job has some sort of dependency on at least one or more jobs or events.

   - The above diagram represents a continuous delivery pipeline in Jenkins. It contains a collection of states such as build, deploy, test and release. These jobs or events are interlinked with each other. Every state has its jobs, which work in a sequence called a continuous delivery pipeline.
  
   - A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression to show your process for getting software for version control. Thus, every change made in your software goes through a number of complex processes on its manner to being released. It also involves developing the software in a repeatable and reliable manner, and progression of the built software through multiple stages of testing and deployment.
  
    ## How does Jenkins Benefit the Buisness
    
- With Jenkins, you’ll get a lot of help. As you can see, it is the most widely used open-source server, therefore you will receive agile teams from all over the world to help you with your problems.
- The users encounter a variety of problems along the way. Such issues are quickly resolved, allowing the software to remain in a state where it may be released at any moment with complete confidence.
- The majority of the integration work is automated. As a result, there are fewer integration issues. This also helps to save money and time during the project’s path.
- The coding problems can be detected as soon as feasible by the engineers. This prevents them from having to deal with large-scale, error-prone integrations.
    
  ## Who is using Jenkins and CICD in the industry
  - More than  60,000 companies  use Jenkins. The companies using Jenkins are most often found in United States and in the Information Technology and Services industry. Jenkins is most often used by companies with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M dollars in revenue
